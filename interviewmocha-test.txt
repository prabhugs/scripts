'''1. Coding Question 	points: 10
Tanika has a set of numbers and has recently studied set theory.
She has created a power set of this set and is writing a program to compute sum of all elements of all the subsets in power set. 

Power set of a set X is defined as set of all possible subsets of X.
Set X consists of all the number from 1 to N.

You need to calculate this sum for a given N.

Example
Given N=3,
X={1,2,3}
P(X) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}
answer = (1)+(2)+(3)+(1+2)+(1+3)+(2+3)+(1+2+3)
= 24

Input
First line contains a number N.

Output
Next line giving answer as defined in the question.

Sample Input
3

Sample Output
24

Note: You should not print any whitespace at the beginning or end of output (e.g. " 5" or "\n5"), unless specifically asked for. Also, printing any extra non-whitespace characters such as "The answer is: 5" will result in a Wrong Answer, as the judging is done using diff checker.
